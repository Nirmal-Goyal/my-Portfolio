            <p>
                I am a software developer currently pursuing a Bsc in Computer Science at BITS Pilani. My primary focus is on full-stack web development and backend engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work mainly with MERN stack and Java-based backend system, and I am actively building a strong foundation in machine learning and data engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                I value clean code, clear system design, and learning through building real-world projects rather than relying solely on tutorials.
            </p>
